- Node.js 16+
- Ollama installed on your system (see installation instructions below)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up Ollama:

```

This script will check if Ollama is installed on your system and guide you through the installation process if it's not.
